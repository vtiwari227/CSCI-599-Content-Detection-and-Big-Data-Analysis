## CSCI-599-Content-Detection-and-Big-Data-Analysis

This repository contain the assignment that we covered during CSCI-599([Content Detection and Big Data Analytics](http://sunset.usc.edu/classes/cs599_2016)) under Prof. [Chris Mattman](http://sunset.usc.edu/~mattmann).

Subject provides a in depth overivew of various Content detection approaches, MetaData cataloging ,Language Detection and Machine Translation techniques.

Assignment-1 (MIME Diversity in TREC Polar DataSet)
-----------------------------------------------------
Learning Byte-based fingerprints of the data via Byte Frequency Analysis (BFA), Byte Frequency Distribution (BFD) Correlation, Byte Frequency Cross-Correlation (BFC), and File Header Trailer (FHT). To implement a set of MIME diversity programs and applications that will help in better understanding these unknown types in a rich scientific domain.Compute BFA,BFC and FHT of these unknown (and other) Polar data types from the dataset, and  build a system that allows visual interaction and introspection of the MIME diversity in this dataset. Those classifications will improve Tikaâ€™s overall ability by suggesting new MIME magic for its database, and improve techniques for MIME detection in the
Big Data present in the TREC-DD-Polar dataset. [read more here](http://sunset.usc.edu/classes/cs599_2016/CS599_HW_MIME_POLAR.pdf)
